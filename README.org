* Overview

A collection of yasnippets for use in Emacs' ESS mode.  

The snippets contain commands for use with the R language. 


* Useage
I write snippets that have the same name as the command I'm building a snippet
template for.  I use the snippets together with company mode's company-yas
backend to rapidly insert functions into my code.  If you're using company's ESS
backend with the company-yas backend, you can distinguish the command from the
snippet by the presence of additional text shown in the snippet.  This
information is each snippet's 'key' attribute in the snippet file.
